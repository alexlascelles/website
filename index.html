    <p>I'm an astrophysicist-turned-neuroscientist currently based in Boston. Right now, I'm pursuing a career within cognitive/computational <br/>
    neuroscience, with broad interests including memory, plasticity, brain augmentation, and the interactions between how we see and how we hear. <br/>
    I also love to compose music and make art.</p>

    <p>Here you'll find out about the research that I'm currently interested in, past projects that I've been involved with, <br/>
    and you'll be able to check out some of the music and art that I have created.</p>
