                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p class="text">I come from a small countryside village in England which sits in an area called the Jurrasic Coast. <br/>
                This part of England is known for its beautiful scenary, with rolling green hills and incredible beaches. <br/>
                <br/>
                I studied MPhys Astrophysics with a Year Abroad at the University of Southampton, and spent my final year at the <br/>
                Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. There, I worked alongside <a class="textlink" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garraffo/" target="_blank">Dr Cecilia Garraffo<a/> and <a class="textlinke" href="http://www.jeremydrake.org/home" target="blank">Dr Jeremy Drake</a>, <br/>
                simulating the environments surrounding binary star systems. <br/>
                <br/>
                Whilst applying to PhD programs in the US, I started auditing a series of classes with topics ranging from astrobiology to <br/>
                sleep science to the neurobiology of perception and decision making. It was during those classes that I started getting <br/>
                really interested in neuroscience and decided to switch fields. <br/>
                <br/>
                This led me to London, where I studied for one year at Goldsmiths College, enrolled in a course entitled <br/> 
                <a class="textlink" href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/msc-music-mind-brain/" target="_blank">MSc Music, Mind and Brain</a>. It was a unique program combining music psychology with neuroscience, focusing <br/>
                on both the biological and cognitive aspects of musical behaviour. <br/>
                <br/>
                This was a really fun year and it allowed me to get back into my music, whilst learning <br/>
                some very cool things about how sound affects our brain! I founded the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2046293425590240/" target="blank">Goldsmiths Jazz and Improv Society<a/> <br/>
                and got more interested in coding &#8212; attending hackathons and taking a class on machine learning. <br/>
                My masters project was an EEG study investigating the neural correlates of a crossmodal correspondence between <br/>
                pitch and visual motion, supervised by <a class="textlink" href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/bhattacharya/" target="_blank">Prof Joydeep Bhattacharya FRSA<a/>. <br/>
                <br/>
                Currently, I'm working as a technical research assistant in Aude Oliva's <a class="textlink" href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/aude.htm" target="_blank">Computational Perception and Cognition Lab<a/> at MIT. <br/>
                <p style="color:#4BB9F4">--------</p>
                <p class="text">
                I've played piano for most of my life and enjoy funk, blues, jazz, and contemporary styles as well as anything improvised. <br/>
                In my spare time, I love to compose piano music, play badminton, draw, juggle, and travel. Whenever I'm in a city, <br/>
                I try to check out a jazz club that I haven't been to before. You can see some of my music and art <a class="textlink" href="music_and_art.html">here</a>.
