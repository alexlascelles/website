                        teaching and data visualization & storytelling.
                        My studies took me from astronomy to neuroscience, but I always kept a strong love for music and art. In
                        my free time, I enjoy drawing, playing music, gaming, badminton, hiking, juggling, travelling, meeting new people, 
                        being in nature, and learning new things. <span

                            I come from a small countryside village in South-West England in an area called the <a

                            This part of the UK is known for its beautiful scenery, rolling green hills, and incredible beaches.
                            Most of my family are still in the UK, so I enjoy going back from time to time.

                            I studied <a class="textlink"

                            at the University of Southampton. I got involved with many different clubs and ended up being the
                            Secretary for the Piano Society, captaining the University Men's Badminton
                            2nd Team, and enjoyed being the Social Secretary for the Badminton Society, organizing events for
                            the largest society on campus. Highlights from that time include 2 weeks in
                            Tenerife designing space telescopes and investigating binary stars using 3 ground telescopes, as
                            well as 2 summer research projects with

                            I enjoyed putting on concerts with the Piano Society and playing at local venues, and traveling
                            around the UK & The Netherlands for badminton.

                            My final year abroad was at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. There, I explored
                            magnetic braking with
                            <a class="textlink" href="https://www.ceciliagarraffo.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Cecilia Garraffo</a>
                            and
                            <a class="textlink" href="https://x.com/cosmodrake" target="blank">Dr. Jeremy Drake</a> by
                            conducting 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of stellar winds to simulate
                            the environments surrounding binary star systems for my thesis work. During my last semester
                            learning about the universe, I became curious about another complex and fascinating
                            system that's a bit closer to home. I audited Harvard & MIT cognitive science classes and spoke with
                            experts in the Boston area before deciding to pursue a master's in neuroscience.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            This led me to London, where I completed an MSc entitled <a class="textlink"

                                Brain"</a> at
                            Goldsmiths College. It was a unique program combining music psychology with neuroscience, focusing
                            on both the biological and cognitive aspects of musical behavior. I had the
                            pleasure of working with <a class="textlink"
                                href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/bhattacharya/" target="_blank">Prof. Joydeep
                                Bhattacharya FRSA</a> to explore interactions
                            between human hearing, vision, and perception for my master's project—an EEG experiment studying the
                            neural correlates of a correspondence between pitch and visual motion.
                            This was a really fun year, and it allowed me to get back into my music while learning some very
                            cool things about how sound affects our brain! I have fun memories of founding the
                            <a class="textlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2046293425590240/"
                                target="blank">Goldsmiths Jazz Society</a> and helping organize a conference on creativity.
                            I also became more interested in coding &#8212; attending hackathons and taking a class on machine
                            learning.
                        </p>

                            After graduating in 2018, I moved back to Boston and spent a few months teaching math to
                            schoolchildren before starting as a technical research associate at MIT. There, I worked with
                            Dr. Aude Oliva in her <a class="textlink" href="http://cvcl.mit.edu/aude.htm"
                                target="_blank">Computational Perception and Cognition Lab</a>. The lab combined human
                            perception/cognition,
                            computer vision (visual AI), and cognitive neuroscience to study how perception and cognition are
                            realized in humans and machines. I spent 5 years in the lab, in charge of a number of
                            duties including programming, running experiments, and data analysis & visualization for
                            neuroimaging (MEG/fMRI) and behavioral (human psychophysics & online) studies. I also helped
                            organize large-scale public challenges and workshops, such as <a class="textlink"
                                href="http://ganocracy.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">GANocracy</a> and
                            <a class="textlink" href="http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">The Algonauts
                                Project</a>. I managed lab equipment, finances, and computational resources/storage, as well as
                            providing web development for lab/project websites, and scheduling meetings/events and other
                            administrative duties. I was involved in group projects with industry partners like Meta,
                            to study action prediction for first-person videos, as well as many group projects within academia
                            with researchers from MIT, other parts of the US and Canada, and Germany.

                            In 2025, I moved to Boulder with my partner to try living in a new city, enjoy life near the mountains, 
                            and to begin a career in teaching. I began working at the 
                            <a class="textlink" href="https://shiningmountainwaldorf.org/" target="_blank">Shining Mountain Waldorf School</a> 
                            teaching math at a middle/high school level, with hopes to teach physics/science in the future. 
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            I've played piano for most of my life and enjoy funk, blues, jazz, and contemporary styles as well
                            as anything improvised. Whenever I'm in a city, I try to check out a jazz club
                            that I haven't been to before. I've also drawn for most of my life &#8212; I started off
                            doodling and drawing cartoons, then slowly got into detailed drawings of mostly animals and
                            structures. I prefer black and white, and mainly use pencils or ink.
