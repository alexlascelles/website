                            <p>I'm interested in a number of different topics within computational and cognitive neuroscience. Firstly, I'm intrigued by human memory, 
                                especially in the visual and auditory domains. Once we understand exactly how memories are encoded, stored, and recalled, I'm interested 
                                to know if we could then augment these processes. You could imagine a world where we are able to "back up" our memories to the cloud, and 
                                even share our memories with others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It also fascinates me how we process and perceive visual and auditory information concurrently. Often, we use information received in the 
                                auditory domain to help us process a visual cue, and vice versa. Although this sometimes leads to negative biases, I wonder if it can be 
                                utilized in a way that enhances information uptake &#8212; perhaps for use in a learning environment. Additionally, I'm interested in using 
                                imaging techniques such as fMRI and MEG to combine my experience with crossmodal correspondences with memory research. The advent of machine 
                                learning and computer vision also presents many interesting opportunities to combine with neuroscientific data which I'm eager to explore.
                            </p>

                                Although I've switched fields, I've kept my love for Astrophysics! I enjoy reading the latest news, and hope someday I'll have the opportunity 
                                to research supernovae once more.

                                        The 2023 edition of <a class="textlink" href="#Algonauts2019">The Algonauts Challenge</a> focused on explaining responses in the human brain 
                                        as participants perceive complex natural visual scenes. Through collaboration with the 
                                        <a class="textlink" href="https://naturalscenesdataset.org/">Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)</a> team, this Challenge ran on the largest suitable 
                                        brain dataset available (brain responses from 8 human participants to in total 73,000 different visual scenes) opening new venues for data-hungry 
                                        modeling. The challenge was organized in partnership with the 
                                        <a class="textlink" href="https://ccneuro.org/" target="_blank">Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN)</a>.

                                        At every blink our eyes are flooded by a massive array of photons &#8212; and yet, we perceive the visual world as ordered and meaningful. 
                                        The primary target of the 2023 Challenge was predicting human brain responses to complex natural visual scenes. We posed the question: Given a set 
                                        of images, how well does your computational model account for the brain activations when a human viewed those images?

                                    <p>
                                        The aim of this project was to collect annotations on egocentric (first-person) videos that have a specific goal which is being carried out. 
                                        This results in visual ground truth data for when a certain goal is taking place within a video. This would be useful for a number of different 
                                        applications, for example, an AI assistant predicting and helping with the next action/goal a human will encounter.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To do this, our team at MIT collaborated with a team at Meta to build an interface to collect data from participants online, selected suitable data sets 
                                        to sample from, collected the data using the Prolific platform, and analyzed the data. The interface was a useful online tool that allowed a user to quickly 
                                        select portions of video while watching, and was flexible enough to be applied to other research aims.

                                        an initiative bringing biological and artificial intelligence researchers together on a 
                                        common platform to exchange ideas and advance both fields. Inspired by the astronauts' exploration of space, "algonauts" explore human and artificial intelligence 
                                        with state-of-the-art algorithmic tools. <a class="textlink" href="http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/2019/index.html" target="_blank">Our first challenge and workshop, 
                                        "Explaining the Human Visual Brain"</a>, focused on building computer vision models that simulate how the brain sees and recognizes <i>objects</i>, a topic that 
                                        has long fascinated neuroscientists and computer scientists.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Across two competition tracks, fMRI and MEG, we gave participants a set of images consisting of everyday objects and the corresponding brain activity recorded 
                                        while human subjects viewed those images. Participants competed to devise computational models that best predicted the brain activity of a brand new set of images. 
                                        The winners were announced at a workshop that we organized at MIT, featuring guest speakers who are some of the leading experts in the field of computational 
                                        neuroscience of vision, from institutions such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, Columbia, FU Berlin, and DeepMind.

                                        Our senses are not independent entities &#8212; instead, they work together to build our realities. When one sense influences another, we call this 
                                        phenomenon <i>crossmodal correspondence</i>. I studied a particular crossmodal correspondence in which ascending/descending pitches as well as the 
                                        spoken words "up"/"down" (auditory domain) were able to bias our perception of visual motion (visual domain).
                                        <br><br>    
                                        I learned MATLAB so I could design and conduct an EEG experiment in which the participant judged the direction of motion of an ambiguous (same 
                                        upwards and downwards components) moving grating whilst listening to the auditory stimuli. Using behavioural and ERP analysis, I showed that 
                                        auditory stimuli were enough to bias peoples' perception of visual motion &#8212; an ascending tone caused more people to perceive upwards motion, 
                                        when in fact there was no overall movement in either direction. This was the first time that this effect was studied using brain imaging techniques.

                                        When main sequence stars such as our Sun orbit a star known as a white dwarf, they can form something called a cataclysmic variable-like binary. The 
                                        charged ions contained within the magnetic fields of these stars creates a complex magnetic <i>wind</i> structure as the two bodies orbit each other. 
                                        When this wind structure decouples from the system it carries away mass and angular momentum, which impacts how the stars spin and how their orbits evolve. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Using 3-D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, I explored the effects of orbital separation and magnetic field configuration on these mass and angular momentum 
                                        loss rates for binary systems. The current models didn't include the magnetic fields of the stars. It was hypothesized that including the magnetic field of 
                                        the white dwarf in the binary system could alter these rates. I found that when including these magnetic fields, the mass and angular momentum loss rates 
                                        dropped by factors of 4 and 6 respectively, suggesting that the current models for these systems should be amended to include the magnetic field.

                                        I attended a hackathon at Brown University where I worked within a team of 5 to design and build an IOT platform called Saguaro. Saguaro allows 
                                        hardware devices to be controlled by a simple web interface. <br><br>
                                        Activating hardware in your home &#8212; lights, windows, anything you can run a wire to &#8212; is as simple as pushing a button. Additionally, 
                                        Saguaro learns your schedule, and over time will be able to anticipate your actions and automate your home for you.

                                        Incredibly, almost half of the star systems that we see in the sky contain multiple stars! This project aimed to simulate planetary orbits around 
                                        a binary (two) star system. This is important to study because such simulations could be used to detect habitable planets outside our solar system (exoplanets). 
                                        For life to exist, the planet on which it occurs must keep a stable orbit over long time-scales. This is similar to the novel "The Three-Body Problem" 
                                        by Liu Cixen, now made into a <a class="textlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mogSbMD6EcY&ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank">Netflix series</a>. <br><br>
                                        To find stable orbits, I used a Runge-Kutta approach to solve the differential equations involved in such a 3-body system and tested various initial 
                                        velocities and separations. I found many different p- and s-type orbits (the two species of stable planetary orbit), as well as some chaotic orbits, 
                                        and discovered whether they possessed a habitable zone where the planet could sustain life.

                                        White dwarf (WD) stars are extremely dense objects &#8212; the only thing preventing them from collapsing into a black hole is a force called 
                                        <a class="textlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure" target="_blank">electron degeneracy pressure</a>, which 
                                        has to do with the fact that electrons cannot be pushed close enough to occupy the same energy state. WDs are very important within astronomy 
                                        &#8212; they appear in many areas of study, including galaxy formation, stellar evolution, and supernovae. Since over 95% of the stars we 
                                        observe will end their lives as WDs, knowing how they function and how their parameters behave is crucial. <br><br>
                                        In this project, I created a model for determining the mass-radius variation in WDs, and ultimately found the critical mass of a WD 
                                        (<a class="textlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar limit</a>), beyond which the 
                                        electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the star and it must collapse into a neutron star or a black hole.

                                        Before I started university, I spent a summer internship at BAE Systems Maritime completing a project focusing on how to reduce physical drag on the 
                                        new class of nuclear submarines. <br/><br/>
                                        I investigated how changes to the bow, control surfaces, fins, and body of the submarine would affect the hydrodynamics of the submarine. I also 
                                        investigated if it would be possible to inject polymers or micro-bubbles to change the way the water flowed over the submarine's surface. Finally, 
                                        I looked into more radical solutions such as supercavitation &#8212; a technology used in some underwater missiles that involves boiling the water 
                                        in front of the supercavitating body to reduce friction drag.
