            A data analysis of my Spotify music collection: artist variety, genre distribution, song lengths, and more.

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Music has always been a big part of my life. Besides playing it, I spend a fair amount of time listening to it 
            &mdash; around 45,000 minutes a year &mdash; that's ~14% of my waking hours! And when people ask you "What music are 
            you into?", I find that's a hard question to answer. Sure, I could list off a few of my favorite bands or genres, 
            but there are so many other things that go into it &mdash; songs don't necessarily fall into a single genre or category, 
            and your preferences depend on your mood, environment, and they change over time. So I decided to start this project 
            as an attempt to quantify some of my musical tastes and, at the very least, satisfy some of my curiosities!
        </p>

        <h3>How Did I Make This?</h3>

        <p>
            This project started with <a href="https://exportify.net/#playlists" target="_blank">Exportify</a> &mdash; 
            a great website where you can download your Spotify playlists in CSV format. From there, I coded a Python script 
            to parse the data from my "Liked Songs" playlist &mdash; the largest playlist I have, containing all of the songs in 
            my library (11,295). I then used pandas and matplotlib to output plots that analyzed various aspects such as 
            artist/genre distributions, song release dates, or musical properties.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I Try It?</h3>

        <p>
            Definitely! If you're curious about your own musical taste and you use a Spotify account, follow these steps below to 
            analyze your musical data:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Head to <a href="https://exportify.net/#playlists" target="_blank">Exportify</a> and click: <br>

            </li>
            <li>
                Extract <code>spotify_analysis_online.py</code> into a folder and put your CSV in the same folder.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open <code>spotify_analysis_online.py</code> in your favorite Python IDE, I like Spyder or VS Code.
                <br>
                Edit line 13 to replace "yourfile.csv" with your CSV filename, then run the script. This will save PNGs and CSVs to a folder named "output" which you can view!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you run into any problems, please <a href="https://www.alexlascelles.com/src/contact.html">contact me</a> and I'll 
            try my best to fix the issue.

    <section id="artist-analysis" class="post-section">
        <h2>Artist Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            I began by analyzing the distribution of artists in my playlist to see who appears most frequently. This is similar to 
            what Spotify does with Spotify Wrapped each year. However, I decided to plot to top 30 artists in my library, ranked by 
            the number of their songs that I have liked.
        </p>
        <img src="images/top_30_artists_alex-liked.png" alt="Artist Analysis Plot Liked Songs">
        <p>
            Since this is data for the entire time I have been using Spotify (13 years), it includes songs I liked back when I was a 
            teenager (mostly the Eminem). I decided to analyze another one of my playlists called <b>"Current Favorites"</b> to see if my 
            favorite artists have changed much over time. I started that playlist 7 years ago, and keep it updated based on my 
            current taste, meaning I also remove songs when I'm no longer a huge fan. Let's see how it compares.
        </p>
        <img src="images/top_30_artists_alex-current_favourites.png" alt="Artist Analysis Plot Current Favourites" style="filter: hue-rotate(30deg);">
        <p>
            This looks like a better representation of my favorite bands at the moment!
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="genre-analysis" class="post-section">
        <h2>Genre Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Next, I tried breaking down the different genres represented in my playlist and identifying the most common ones. Spotify tags 
            each song with a number of different genres, and each song can have multiple genres assigned. What genres do I listen to?
        </p>
        <img src="images/top_30_genres_alex-liked.png" alt="Genre Analysis Plot">
        <p>
            I had no idea what "permanent wave" or "mellow gold" were so had to look them up. 

            <section class="quote-section">
                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <span class="quote-marks">" </span><b>Permanent wave</b> is characterized by a heavy reliance on synthesizers and drum machines, as well as a strong emphasis 
                    on melody and rhythm. It often combines elements of pop, funk, and rock music. <span class="quote-marks"> "</span>
                </blockquote>
            </section>

            <section class="quote-section">
                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <span class="quote-marks">" </span><b>Mellow Gold</b> contains elements of soft rock and folk rock, and has a strong correlation with album-oriented classic 
                    rock of the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Emphasis is on clean production, harmonies, and melodic compositions.<span class="quote-marks"> "</span>
                </blockquote>
            </section>

            And again, let's do it for my <b>"Current Favorites"</b> playlist:
        </p>
        <img src="images/top_30_genres_alex-current_favourites.png" alt="Artist Analysis Plot Current Favourites" style="filter: hue-rotate(30deg);">
        <p>
            Never thought I'd be listening to "yacht rock".
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="song-length" class="post-section">
        <h2>Song Length Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Let's explore the distribution of song lengths.
        </p>
        <img src="images/song_length_distribution_alex-liked.png" alt="Song Length Distribution Plot">
        <p>
            My average song is 4:28, which is quite a bit longer than the average (~3:30). I'd put this down to listening to a lot of jazz 
            and metal, which tend to be longer. Interestingly, average song length has changed over time, gradually increasing since the 60s 
            before reaching a peak around the early 90s at around 4 minutes.
        </p>

        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="release-date" class="post-section">
        <h2>Song Release Date Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Next, I wanted to see which era the songs that I listen to are from.
        </p>
        <img src="images/song_release_decade_distribution_alex-liked.png" alt="Song Release Decade Distribution Plot">
        <p>
            It looks like my musical taste exponentially decays the further back in time we travel, with a bit of a 
            lull around the 80s. I would expect it to be generally anchored around your birth year and grow from that 
            time onwards, as new music gets released during your lifetime. I was born in the 90s, so that checks out; 
            still, I'd be curious to test this by looking at the data for people of different ages. The amount of music 
            released has also grown over time (check out this 
            <a href="https://blog.s-schoener.com/2018-02-03-music-data/" target="_blank">cool blog post</a> by Sebastian 
            Schöner), which might contribute towards this exponential decay shape. Personal preference almost certainly 
            plays a part, too &mdash; despite being a millennial, I'm a big fan of older music, especially from the 70s.
            <br><br>
            What about for my <b>"Current Favorites"</b> playlist?
        </p>
        <img src="images/song_release_decade_distribution_alex-current_favourites.png" alt="Song Release Decade Distribution Plot Current Favorites" style="filter: hue-rotate(30deg);">
        <p>
            Pretty much the same distribution, except more songs from the 70s!
            <br><br>
            Let's look in more detail by plotting the exact years instead of the decades. <b>"Liked Songs"</b> on top and <b>"Current Favorites"</b> below.
        </p>

        <img src="images/song_release_year_distribution_alex-liked.png" alt="Song Release Year Distribution Plot">

        <p>
            Seems like 2013 is my overall favorite year for music, with 657 songs coming from that year alone! 
            My favorites playlist peaks a bit later, around 2016. I wonder in the dip at 2020 was due to the pandemic.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="date-added" class="post-section">
        <h2>Date Added to Library</h2>
        <p>
            I started using Spotify in 2011. However, Spotify subsequently changed the way that songs were saved into playlists. 
            In 2017 I started using the "Liked Songs" feature, and added all the songs from my previous playlists there. 
            So let's take a look at how I added music to my library from 2017 onwards. I tracked the dates when songs 
            were added to my library to see when I've been most active in saving music. 
            <br><br>
            <b>*Note*</b> in Sep 2021 I added a whole bunch of songs at once, so we should ignore this datapoint. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/songs_added_by_year_alex-liked.png" alt="Year Added Distribution Plot">
        <p>
            It looks like 2023 was a big year for music exploration! During the pandemic years, I also added quite a lot of songs. 
            I was traveling for a large part of 2024, which might explain the dip there. Let's look at a monthly breakdown to see 
            which months of the year I'm generally most active.
        </p>
        <img src="images/songs_added_by_month_alex-liked.png" alt="Month Added Distribution Plot">
        <p>
            Looks like Feb, Jun, Aug, and Dec are when I am searching for and adding most of my music.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="musical-properties" class="post-section">
        <h2>Musical Properties</h2>
        <p>
            Spotify outputs a range of musical properties such as tempo, danceability, and valence. I think they are more of 
            an estimate than an exact science, so this section should be taken with a pinch of salt. Regardless, let's take a 
            look to scope out the overall mood and feel of my library.
        </p>
        <img src="images/continuous_properties_distribution_alex-liked.png"
            alt="Continuous Musical Properties Distribution Plot">
            <p>
                Valence stands out to me, since I always seem to prefer songs in a minor key, and not "happy" songs. 
                Rock and metal tend to be more angsty and like this, which adds up here. Tempo is also interesting, since 
                musicians tend to prefer a tempo of 120 bpm (it's commonly said that this is best tempo for a "hit" song) 
                and we can see that in the data here. It's negatively skewed suggesting I slightly prefer slower songs which 
                seems true as well. 
                <br><br>
                Let's look at the categorical variables Mode, Key, and Time Signature &mdash; comparing them against 
                my <b>"Current Favorites"</b> playlist below again:
            </p>
        <img src="images/categorical_properties_distribution_alex-liked.png"

            alt="Categorical Musical Properties Distribution Plot Current Favorites" style="filter: hue-rotate(30deg);">
            <p>
                My theory about preferring minor keys is again confirmed here. C, D, Db, E, F, G, and A are all popular 
                keys, while Eb and Gb are rarely used which is funny since Ebm is one of my favorite keys to play in.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            This was a fun project which revealed some interesting facts about my musical tastes. I'd be interested to do 
            some deeper analysis and perhaps compare my data against someone else's &mdash; for example, it'd be cool 
            to see a plot showing how much your musical tastes overlap with someone (like a "Music Compatibility Score") or 
            see which of your top 50 artists do they also listen to. Let me know if you have any ideas, and thanks for reading!
